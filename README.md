# Pivotal Tracker Copier
This extension is in the very first stage of development.
My hope is that it could save it user some time by helping with the tedious works of copying things from PT.
Although it need more work to make it reliable, so please double check the content it generated the first few times.
Ideas, feedbacks, suggestions and of course contributions are more than welcome.
## For developent
Load extension from local file system see [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked]
